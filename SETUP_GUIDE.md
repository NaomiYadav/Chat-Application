# Complete Setup Guide for Real-Time Chat Application

## Step 1: Install Node.js

Before running this chat application, you need to install Node.js on your system.

### Download and Install Node.js:
1. Go to [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download the **LTS (Long Term Support)** version for Windows
3. Run the installer (.msi file)
4. Follow the installation wizard (accept all default settings)
5. **Important**: Make sure to check "Add to PATH" during installation

### Verify Installation:
Open a new PowerShell/Command Prompt window and run:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```
You should see version numbers for both commands.

## Step 2: Install Project Dependencies

1. **Open PowerShell** and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd "c:\Users\acer\Downloads\unified mentor\Chat-Application"
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Step 3: Start the Application

1. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open your browser** and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Step 4: Test the Application

### Testing Real-Time Features:
1. **Open multiple browser tabs** or windows
2. **Register different users** in each tab
3. **Join the same chat room** from different tabs
4. **Send messages** and see them appear in real-time across all tabs

### Testing Responsive Design:
1. **Resize your browser window** to test mobile view
2. **Use browser developer tools** (F12) to simulate mobile devices
3. **Test on actual mobile devices** if available

## Alternative: Demo Mode (Without Server)

If you can't install Node.js right now, I've created a demo version that shows the UI design:

1. Open `demo.html` in your browser
2. This shows the chat interface design without real-time functionality
3. You can see how the responsive design works

## Project Features You'll Experience:

### üîê Authentication System
- User registration with validation
- Secure login with JWT tokens
- Password hashing for security

### üí¨ Real-Time Chat
- Instant message delivery using WebSockets
- Multiple chat rooms (General, Technology, Random)
- Typing indicators when users are typing
- User presence (see who's online)

### üì± Responsive Design
- Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Modern gradient design
- Smooth animations and transitions

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + Socket.IO
- **Frontend**: HTML5 + CSS3 + JavaScript
- **Real-time**: WebSocket communication
- **Security**: JWT authentication, password hashing

## Troubleshooting:

### If npm install fails:
1. Make sure Node.js is properly installed
2. Try running PowerShell as Administrator
3. Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`

### If the server won't start:
1. Check if port 3000 is already in use
2. Try changing the port in `.env` file
3. Make sure all dependencies are installed

### If real-time features don't work:
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Ensure you're using a modern browser
3. Try refreshing the page

## Learning Objectives Achieved:

This project demonstrates BTech 3rd year level skills in:
